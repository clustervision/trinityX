        # (network, HBA, expander, disks, etc).

        # which has higher priority, occurs. If set to 0, then app I/O detection
        # is disabled and the resync consumes as much BW as possible, up to the
        # c-max-rate amount.

        # trying to resync. Both of them require live hardware tests.

        # The first one is to limit the amount of in-flight data, rather than
        # saturating the buffers. That way when an app I/O comes in, it doesn't
        # have to wait until the full buffers are transferred, which improves
        # latency a bit.
        # This should be set to the minimum that still allows you to reach full
        # datapath bandwidth on an idle system.
        # 100k is recommended as a good starting point.
        # If set to 0, the second method is used.

        # The second way is measure the delay in response between the
        # controllers. When it becomes longer than this value (the latency
        # increases), it is assumed that the data path is at full capacity and
        # the resync process throttles down. In effect it's the maximum
        # acceptable latency. Warning: sensitive to network issues!
