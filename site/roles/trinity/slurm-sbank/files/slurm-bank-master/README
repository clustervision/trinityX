SLURM BANK
==========

SLURM Bank, a collection of wrapper scripts to give slurm GOLD like
capabilities for managing resources.

With the scripts we are able to provide a simple banking system where we
can deposit hours to an account. Users are associated to these accounts
from which they can use to run jobs. If users do not have an account or
if they do not have hours in their account then they cannot run jobs.

Requirements (tested with)

* SLURM 2.2.0, 2.2.7, 2.4.1, 2.5.3, 2.6.x, 14.11.x, 15.08.x
* Scientific Linux 5.x, 6.x (bash, rsync, perl)

Source and Documentation
========================

The documentation is stored in doc/ and is generated with ikiwiki,
that is, all the documentation is written in markdown.

There is a pre-generated set of documentation available at
<http://jcftang.github.com/slurm-bank/>

To get the source and documentation please do

	git clone git://github.com/jcftang/slurm-bank.git

Administrator Notes
===================

To build an installable RPM from the tarball

	rpmbuild -ta slurm-bank-1.1.1.2.tar.gz

The above assumes that the appropriate compiler and rpm-build packages
are installed on your system. You will need ikiwiki installed to generate
the html documetation. If you do not have ikiwiki installed you can do:

	rpmbuild -ta --without docs slurm-bank-1.1.1.2.tar.gz

If you have a clone of the repository, there is a pre-generated set of
html pages stored in the html branch.

Tests
=====

There is a simple test suite to make sure things are working as we
expect. To execute them,

	make test

The tests behave differently if you run them as a normal user or as root.

Doing a release
===============

* clone the git repository
* Finalise changes
* Run bump-version script to make some version number changes to various files
* Tag repository
* then run "make dist" to generate a tarball for redistribution
