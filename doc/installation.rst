TrinityX installation procedure
================================

This document describes the installation of a TrinityX controller, as well as the creation and configuration of an image for the compute nodes of a TrinityX cluster.

Starting with Release 11, Ansible is fully integrated into TrinityX. This allows for a lot of flexibility when installing a cluster.

The requirements for all components of a TrinityX cluster are described in the :doc:`requirements`. It is assumed that the guidelines included in this document have been followed, and that the controller machines are ready for the TrinityX configuration.

.. note:: While the procedure to create compute images must be run from the cluster controller (the primary controller when in HA mode), the installation procedure of the controllers themselves can be executed from any arbitrary machine (including your laptop).

Controller installation
-----------------------

The TrinityX configuration tool will install and configure all packages required to set up a working TrinityX controller.

The configuration for a default controller installation is described in the file ``controller.yml``, as well as the files located in the ``group_vars/`` subdirectory of the TrinityX tree, while the list of machines to which the configuration needs to be applied is described in the file called ``hosts``::

    # pwd
    ~/trinityX/site/

    # ls hosts controller.yml group_vars/
    hosts  controller.yml

    group_vars/:
    all


These files can be edited to reflect the user's own installation choices. For a full list of configuration options supported by TrinityX, refer to :doc:`configuration`.

Once the configuration files are ready, the ``controller.yml`` Ansible playbook can be run to apply the configuration to the controller(s)::

    # pwd
    ~/trinityX/site/

    # ansible-playbook controller.yml

.. note:: By default, high availability is enabled in the installer, so it expects to have access to two machines which will become the controllers. To install a non-HA version, you need to update the ``ha`` variable in ``group_vars/all``. For more details on the high availability configuration you can consult :doc:`ha_design`.

If more verbose output is desired during the installation process, you can use ``ansible-playbook``'s ``-v`` option. The verbosity level will increase according to the number of ``v``.
For further details about the use of Ansible, including its command line options, please consult the `official Ansible documentation <https://docs.ansible.com/>`_.


`controller.yml` playbook
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When running this playbook for the first time, you will see initial warnings that some luna inventory could not be parsed. Luna is the cluster provisioning tool included in TrinityX. What these warnings mean is that `luna` could not be queried for a list of nodes and osimages. This is normal at this point of the installation, since luna has not been configured yet::

    [WARNING]:  * Failed to parse /etc/ansible/hosts/luna with script plugin: Inventory script
    (/etc/ansible/hosts/luna) had an execution error: Traceback (most recent call last):   File
    "/etc/ansible/hosts/luna", line 3, in <module>     from luna_ansible.inventory import LunaInventory
    File "/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/luna_ansible/inventory.py", line 15, in <module>     raise
    AnsibleError("luna is not installed") ansible.errors.AnsibleError: luna is not installed
    
    [...]


The rest of the output would be a list of all the tasks that Ansible is running on controller(s)::

    [...] 

    TASK [trinity/init : Update the trix_ctrl_* variables in case of non-HA setup] **************************
    ok: [controller]
    
    TASK [trinity/init : Toggle selinux state] **************************************************************
     [WARNING]: SELinux state temporarily changed from 'enforcing' to 'permissive'. State change will take
    effect next reboot.
    
    changed: [controller]
    
    [...] 
    
    TASK [trinity/repos : Ensure "/trinity/repos" exists] ***************************************************
    changed: [controller]
    
    [...] 


Then at the end, if everything was successful, you will be able to see a summary of all the actions that Ansible has performed, including how many changes and how many failures::

    PLAY RECAP **********************************************************************************************
    controller                 : ok=270  changed=197  unreachable=0    failed=0


Keep in mind that if some of the tasks fail during the installation, Ansible won't stop until it finishes running all the other tasks. If this happens, Ansible can be used to only re-apply the failing task, the full role containing it, or the entire playbook, after the cause of the failure has been fixed.


What are the passwords?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

By default, the TrinityX installer will generate random passwords for all services that require one. You can find all of the generated passwords on the controller(s) at `/etc/trinity/passwords/` where every password lives in its own file that's named after the service that uses it.


Compute node image creation
---------------------------

The creation and configuration of an OS image for the compute nodes uses the same tool and a similar configuration file as for the controller. While the controller configuration applies its setting to the machine on which it runs, the image configuration does so in a directory that will contain the whole image of the compute node.

.. note:: Building a new image isn't required for most system administration tasks. One of the images existing on your system can be cloned and modified. Creating a new image is only useful for an initial installation, or when desiring to start from a clean one. Another scenario might be a cluster where all configuration (creation, deletion, ...) must be fully controlled by Ansible - in this case to create the image it is possible to copy ``compute.yml`` and update ``image_name`` variable to reflect the new image's name.


The setup of the default image is defined in the playbook ``compute.yml``, which controls the creation of a new filesystem directory and applies the image configuration. The ``compute.yml`` file includes the ``trinity-image.yml`` playbook as a dependency. The latter is a playbook that applies a standard Trinity image configuration.


In the vast majority of cases, changing the configuration of the default image is not required. It may be desired, however, to set up a custom root password, in which case the variable ``image_password`` can be set to the desired password.

Creating a new image is as simple as setting up the controller(s)::

    # ansible-playbook compute.yml

.. note:: Any newly created image will reside in the directory defined by the configuration variable ``trix_image`` which points to `/trinity/images/` by default.

After the configuration has completed, the node image is ready and integrated into the provisioning system. No further steps are required.


Updating images and nodes
-------------------------

It is worth pointing out that ``compute.yml`` or any copy thereof can be applied to both existing images and/or live nodes without issues. All that needs to be done is updating the list of hosts to which it applies.

By default ``compute.yml`` applies to the host `compute.osimages.luna` which means it only applies to the image called `compute`. It is, therefore, possible to apply the same playbook to all images, a compute node, or all nodes if so desired. To do so, the hosts definitions in both ``trinity-image.yml`` and ``compute.yml`` will need to be updated to either of the following:

    - "osimages.luna" which will cover all osimages defined in Luna.
    - "nodes.luna" which will cover all nodes defined in Luna.
    - "node001.nodes.luna" which will only cover node001 as is defined in Luna.
