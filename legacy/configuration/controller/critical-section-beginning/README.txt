TrinityX secondary installation bootstrap data
==============================================

This directory contains the essential data that will be used to bootstrap the
installation of the secondary controller. It is created during the installation
of the primary controller, and copied over to the NFS share at the end of the HA
setup post scripts.

As it contains sensitive information, it can be deleted after the installation
of the secondary controller.
