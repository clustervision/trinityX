# CentOS that will be installed.
# If not set, all files called "centos-release*.rpm" will be installed (which

# Use the host repositories for the installation if the image?
# In most cases you will want to use the same repos. The only time you won't
# want to do it is if you install a different OS version and some host repos are
# causing issues. In that case, disable the host repos to use only the stock
# repositories of your OS version.
# Note that if you disable the host repos, you will need internet access to
# install the packages, as they won't be in the host yum cache.
# Disabling the host repos also disables using the host yum cache.
# Comment out to disable the host repos, set to 1 to keep them.

# Do a yum update in the image before executing the post scripts?
# Comment out to disable, set to 1 do do the update.

# Comment out to do only the base OS installation and leave the image
# unconfigured.
