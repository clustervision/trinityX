Post scripts
============


Components of a post script
---------------------------

A post script is made up of multiple distinct files and a directory, each with a different role. All of them are optional, so that any post script can provide only what is necessary for its purpose.

Those files must share their basename (i.e. the filename without any extension), and that basename is the name of the post script as a whole. Even if the post script is only made of one shell script, called ``myscript.sh`` for example, for the purpose of the configuration tool the name of the post script is ``myscript``, not ``myscript.sh``.

In the order in which they are processed by the configuration tool, the files are:

- a list of yum package groups to install, with the extension ``.grplist``;

- a list of packages to install, with the extension ``.pkglist``;

- a valid Bash script with the extension ``.sh``;

- a directory that contains additional files that may be required by your script, without any extension.

The groups are installed first, then the packages, then the script is executed. The directory itself is not touched by the configuration script. Its path is exported to the script via a shell enviromnent variable (``POST_FILEDIR``) so that the script can manage an additional set of private files that reside in that directory. Note that if the directory doesn't exist, then the environment variable will be unset.

In the group and package files, all non-empty lines and lines not starting with a ``#`` are assumed to contain only names of either groups or packages. In particular, comments on the same line as group / package names are not supported.

As all of those files are optional, no error message will be displayed if any of them doesn't exist. If none exists, then it will be treated as if the shell script exited with an error code, which will display an error message by default.



Rules for post script creation
------------------------------


Typical structure of the Bash script
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


General rules
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Separate your code and data. In other words, as much as possible don't define whole configuration files as strings in the shell script. Some of it is unavoidable (changing an option value, appending a line, etc -- use the provided functions for that!), but if you're copying whole files, then use the post script's private directory and copy them from there. See ``POST_FILEDIR`` in `Environment variables`_.

- If you really have to chose between mutually exclusive sets of packages (for example Nagios + Ganglia vs. Zabbix), create multiple post scripts that can be toggled on and off by commenting them out in the configuration file. Especially for different versions of a given package, or support for different CentOS releases, write separate post scripts.

- Never download anything inside the shell script. No RPM, no repo file, nothing. Assume that the installation is done on a site without connectivity, and make everything available locally. Remember that you can have a private directory for your own files.

- Never, ever, **under any circumstance**, install any package yourself inside the shell script. Let the configuration tool install packages for you, see `Package management`_ for details. If you need to install a repo RPM (or a repo file, or a repo GPG key), check the ``additional-repos`` post script.


Default behaviour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Try to make your scripts as `idempotent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence>`_ as possible, that is; being able to run multiple times without changing the results beyond those of the first run. Some functions are provided to help with that goal, those are described in `Common functions`_.

- At the very least, make sure that the shell script doesn't do any damage when the state of the system at the beginning of execution is not what expected. In other words, don't make too many assumptions and do a few checks at the beginning. The sane default behaviour when a configuration already exists is to wipe it and start clean (a.k.a. the big red reset button), so that re-running a post script that failed restarts it from the beginning.


Package management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Do not install packages directly from the shell script. Instead, create a matching ``.grplist`` or ``.pkglist`` for those.

- Do not store big binary files in the post script directory, or anywhere really. Git doesn't like that. If it's an RPM then ship in in the local repo. If it's a shared application, put it with the other applications.

- The only exceptions to the above rule are the small RPMs used for additional repositories. Copy them to the private directory of the ``additional-repos`` post script, and they will be installed and ready before processing your own post script.

- local repos


Variable management
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Feel free to append information to ``/etc/trinity.sh``, as long as it's only environment variables and it's pertinent. This file is sourced automatically and its contents made available to all post scripts. See `Environment variables`_ and `Common functions`_ for more details and the correct way to do so.

- Print out the variables that you will need at the beginning of your script. That way, the output messages will contain the exact state of the post script's input. Use the function ``display_var`` for that, see `Common functions`_.

- Be careful in the choice of your variables in the configuration file. If possible, try to have a sane default value if no config option is set (i.e., empty configuration). For example, if ``something`` is required in 99% if cases but you want to give the option to disable it, make it ``DISABLE_SOMETHING`` and not ``ENABLE_SOMETHING``. With an empty config file, ``ENABLE_SOMETHING`` would not be set and that would break the 99% of cases. When a configuration option **must** have a value (for example a path to a file), make sure that you have a fallback value if the option is not set, and document it very well next to the option in ``controller.cfg`` and your shell script.

- Regarding the naming of configuration variables: for each option specific to a post script, pick a prefix that matches or refers to that script. For example, all options for the ``chrony`` post script start with ``CHRONY_``. That makes things much cleaner and clearer. General options (such as IP addresses, for example) can have non-prefixed names, but then it's up to you to make sure that there is no name collision and that the option name makes sense.

- The prefix ``TRIX_`` is reserved for the values contained in ``/etc/trinity.sh``. Never use it as a configuration option prefix.

- All configuration variables must be added to the file `controller.cfg`_, which serves as the reference. The variables for a given post script must be listed under a header containing the name of the post script; see the file for examples. They must be set to a sane value or commented out.

- All the configuration variables added to `controller.cfg`_ must be documented: what their role is, what range of values do they accept, what their default option is if not set.
