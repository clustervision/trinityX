# - TRIX_LOCAL for configuration files specific to each machine
# - TRIX_SHARED for everything shared by the controllers to the nodes
#
# By default those exist under TRIX_ROOT. There are some cases where this is not

# IP addresses of the ring 0 communication network for Corosync
# If unset, they will default to the main IP addresses for both controllers.
# Not that the two IPs must be on the same network (subnet / netmask), and must
# be able to communicate with each other (rather obviously).
# It is highly recommended to leave the ring 0 on the main IP addresses, and to
# do custom configuration of Corosync to add other rings for other networks (IB,
# IPMI, anything that can help determine if a controller is down).

#COROSYNC_CTRL1_IP=
#COROSYNC_CTRL2_IP=

# Password for the "hacluster" user
# Pacemaker expect all nodes that are part of the HA cluster to have a local
# user called "hacluster", with the same password everywhere.
# A random one will be generated if unset.

# Ethernet cards without HW support.
# This does not remove the ability to use the regular TCP proto, and is safe to

# offline installation later.
# Set to 1 to enable persistent cache, comment out otherwise.

YUM_PERSISTENT_CACHE=1

# Clear yum cache before installing anything?
# This is mostly useful to make sure that the cache will not have any leftover
# package from some other repo, so that we can have a clean list of packages
# for an offline installation later.
# In doubt, don't clear the cache.
# Set to 1 to clear the cache, comment out to keep it.

# Disable all remote repositories?
# This is only useful for offline installations where the systems will be

# ISC BIND doesn't support dynamic (eg. DHCP-provided) DNS forwarders. As we

# For a regular HPC installation, those are the local or ISP DNS.
# On machines that change network often and are configured via DHCP, use
# network-independant DNS services (Google or OpenDNS for example).
# IPs are space-separated. If not set, no forwarder configuration will be done
# (which seems to work anyway half of the time).
# Google:  8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4
# OpenDNS: 208.67.22{0,2}.22{0,2}

BIND_FORWARDERS="8.8.8.8 8.8.4.4"
