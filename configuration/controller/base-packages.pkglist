# Additional package list
# All empty lines and lines starting with a # will be ignored

# No group names! Those go into a .grplist file.

# Packages that require complex post-install scripts (more than simply enabling
# a service) go into their own post files.
# Packages that come from an extra repo (which may not be enabled) go into the
# additional-packages list.
# The rest goes here.
