# handler file for nfs

# RH7 uses a weird configuration system for NFS. At boot the
# nfs-config.service unit file processes /etc/sysconfig/nfs and writes the
# results in /run/sysconfig/nfs-utils, which is used by the NFS server.
# I'm not really sure about the logic behind it. What it means for us though
# is that we have to restart that service after updating the config file.
